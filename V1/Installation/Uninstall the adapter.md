# Uninstall the adapter

Complete one of the following procedures for your operating system to uninstall an OSIsoft adapter:

## Windows

1. To remove the OSIsoft adapter program files from a Windows device, use the Windows Control Panel uninstall application process.

    **Note:** The configuration, data, and log files are not removed by the uninstall process.

2. Optional: To remove data, configuration and log files, remove the directory _%ProgramData%\OSIsoft\Adapters\AdapterName_.

   **Note:** If logging is enabled for the adapter, you need to end the process before you can delete the files.

    This will delete all data processed by the adapter in addition to configuration and log files.


## Linux

1. To remove OSIsoft adapter software from a Linux device, open a terminal window and run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt remove osisoft.adapters.<AdapterName>
    ```

2. Optional: To remove data, configuration, and log files, remove the directory _/usr/share/OSIsoft/Adapters/AdapterName_.

    This will delete all data processed  by the adapter, in addition to configuration and log files.

    Alternatively, you can run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo rm -r /usr/share/OSIsoft/Adapters/<AdapterName>
    ```
